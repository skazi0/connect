# When configuring a proxy with "yast2 proxy", the proxy url is written to ~/.curlrc
# and /etc/sysconfig/proxy. The proxy credentials are only written to ~/.curlrc.
# At login session init, the values from /etc/sysconfig/proxy are set in the environment,
# from where Net::Http is picking them up. Unfortunately the proxy credentials are
# not prepended to the proxy url, but stored seperately in .curlrc. Net::Http isn't picking
# them up automatically from there, that's why we need to parse them manually from .curlrc
